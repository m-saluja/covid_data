Project Title: Analysis and Visualization of COVID-19 Death and Vaccination Data

Description:
This project involved analyzing COVID-19 death and vaccination data using MySQL queries, table joins, and CTE. Two tables, covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations, were used to store the data. The MySQL queries were designed to calculate total deaths, vaccination rates, and identify trends.
Views were created to simplify complex queries.
The next phase focused on visualizing the data in Tableau. Various charts and graphs were used to present the insights gained from the analysis. --->The dashboard created in Tableau provided an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the data. 
Decision-makers and health professionals could utilize the dashboard to make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively.

In summary, this project combined data analysis with Tableau visualization to provide valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling better decision-making and resource management.
